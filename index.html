    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my personal corner of the web! I'm Felix Guzman, a passionate Web Developer with a knack for crafting digital experiences. I am on a journey to explore the vast realms of technology and create innovative solutions that leave a lasting impression.</p>

    <p>My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Software Development from Brigham Young University - Idaho, where I honed my skills in developing applications across diverse domains. During my studies, I delved into the world of web development, creating visually captivating, user-centric websites that adhere to industry standards and best practices. I'm always eager to leverage cutting-edge technologies to elevate my programming skills and efficiency.</p>

    <p>As a proud recipient of an Associate Certificate in Web & Computer Programming, I have engineered Single Page Applications (SPAs) using JavaScript and node.js. My approach to projects involves orchestrating seamless teamwork, promoting robust collaboration, and effective communication. I enjoy integrating APIs into websites to enhance functionality and user satisfaction. I'm also adept at utilizing tools like Trello for streamlined project management, both individually and collaboratively.</p>

    <p>Beyond my technical skills, I hold a PathwayConnect Certificate from BYU-Pathway Worldwide, emphasizing proficiency in English language, effective online collaboration, and the nurturing of leadership and problem-solving skills.</p>

    <p>Having earned Basic and Industrial Electronic Certificates from Infotep-Loyola, I have a solid foundation in designing electronic programs and solutions, troubleshooting, and resolving device issues.</p>

    <p>Outside the realm of technology, I currently serve as the Branch President at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, fostering member growth and mentoring individuals to cultivate spiritual and personal ambition.</p>

    <p>Feel free to explore my projects, and if you have any questions or collaboration ideas, don't hesitate to get in touch. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
